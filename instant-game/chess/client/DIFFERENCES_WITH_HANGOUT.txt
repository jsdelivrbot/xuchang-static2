Alas, the stand-alone code has split from the Hangout code:

 - Hangouts cannot encode complex sub-objects, so the piece faces need
   to be pushed into a single JSON string and encoded as
   "faces_array". Meanwhile, the JSON string confuses the PHP server
   so it must instead need to be kept as a "faces" array.

 - Hangouts make the a DIV the #board, while the stand-alone labels
   the BODY as #board.  This has direct impact on the calculation of
   where events occur.  In a DIV we need to subtract the location of
   the scrollbars, while that shouldn't be done with the BODY.
   Unfortunately, if we make the stand-alone version use a DIV tag,
   that ruins scroll ability on iOS.

 - Hangouts simplified the code and uses an overlay for single piece
   mouse events and rotations.  Unfortunately this makes touch not
   work if you want to simply click-drag a piece.  Making the overlay
   stops subsequent touchmove events.  This means that touch events
   for Hangouts may be broken (something to test on Windows tablets
   and touch Chromebooks).
